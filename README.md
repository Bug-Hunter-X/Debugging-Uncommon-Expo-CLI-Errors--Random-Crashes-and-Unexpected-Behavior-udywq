# Debugging Uncommon Expo CLI Errors in Expo Projects

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug, issue in Expo projects: seemingly random crashes and unexpected behavior stemming from library incompatibilities or environment inconsistencies.

## Problem

Many Expo projects encounter errors that aren't easily traceable through typical debugging methods. These errors may manifest as random crashes, unexpected behavior in certain parts of the application, or inconsistencies between local development and deployment using EAS Build.  The error messages may be unhelpful or point towards unrelated code sections.

## Solution

The solution involves a systematic approach: careful dependency management, thorough testing, and attention to environmental factors. This often requires isolating the problematic code and checking compatibility across different environments.

### Steps to Debug

1. **Identify the problematic code:**  Isolate components or code sections that exhibit the unpredictable behavior. This often involves systematically commenting out parts of the code to narrow down the source.
2. **Dependency review:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with your current Expo version and have no known issues. Check package.json for any conflict or out-of-date packages.  Consider using tools like `npm-check-updates`.
3. **Clean and rebuild:** Clean your project, and then try to rebuild it from scratch.  Removing the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies is advisable.
4. **Environment consistency:**  Verify the environment in which the error occurs. This includes comparing dependency versions (especially native modules) between your local machine and the build environment (EAS Build). This could involve utilizing environment-specific configurations or environment variables.
5. **Reproduce the issue:** Once identified, create a small, isolated reproduction case if possible, allowing for more straightforward investigation.
6. **Community support:** If the issue persists, seek assistance from the Expo community forums or GitHub issues. Providing detailed information, including reproduction steps, error messages, and your project setup, increases the chance of receiving helpful feedback.

This repository provides examples of such errors and demonstrates strategies for their resolution.

The solution is highly dependent on the specific error encountered. However, here's a general approach using best practices.   This example focuses on dependency conflicts:

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative Example - might not produce an actual error)
import React from 'react';
import InconsistentLibrary from 'inconsistent-library'; // Hypothetical library

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo App</Text>
      <InconsistentLibrary />
    </View>
  );
}
```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative Solution)
import React from 'react';
import CompatibleLibrary from 'compatible-library'; // Replace with a known compatible library

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo App</Text>
      <CompatibleLibrary />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Key improvements in the solution:**

* **Dependency Replacement:** Replaced the potentially problematic `InconsistentLibrary` with `CompatibleLibrary`. This highlights the importance of verifying library compatibility.
* **Thorough Testing:** Before and after the replacement, ensure thorough testing is performed in multiple environments to validate the fix.
* **Version control:**  Always maintain a well-managed package.json, noting explicit version requirements to prevent conflicts from updated packages.

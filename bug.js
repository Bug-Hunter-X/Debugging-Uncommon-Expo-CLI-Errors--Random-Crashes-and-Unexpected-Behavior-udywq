This error typically occurs when you are using a feature or library in Expo that is not fully compatible with the current version of Expo CLI or its dependencies.  It often manifests as seemingly random crashes or unexpected behavior.  A common cause is using a library that's not yet optimized for EAS Build or has issues with newer versions of React Native or Expo modules.  The error messages themselves are often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.  It's also possible for this to happen due to environment inconsistencies between development and deployment. For example, a specific dependency version might work on your local machine but not on the EAS Build server.
